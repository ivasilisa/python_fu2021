real life stories in academia https://t.co/RLZCscKvpM
--------------------------------
Let it be said that every time an academic extends a 'here's a PhD opportunity you might like/I'll keep an eye out for you' message, I am unbelievably touched.

I know academia has its fair share of ills, but somehow I found myself a nice lil' snug corner with very lovely people.
--------------------------------
@aquicarattino For PIs that supervised but don‚Äôt plan to quit academia it‚Äôs more difficult. I‚Äôd say less than 5%, if any. Loyalty comes in resource sharing when the start up is healthy, i would offer sponsoring PhD students over giving equity. Good litmus test for true intentions of the PI
--------------------------------
I've heard the clich√© "academia is stuffy." Can't confirm that at end of 1st-year pt PhD. I've met incredible people, willing to share ideas &amp; resources, having lively discussions + embracing new thoughts. I'm glad to have this A&amp;H network. #phdlife #AcademicTwitter @PhDVoice

@ZhengZefan Indeed. If there‚Äôs a rule I‚Äôve learned in academia (I believe it was @Deouell, then my  PhD supervisor, who conveyed it to me), this is it: take the time you estimate the project to last, double it and add two more months - and even then it might take longer ;-)
--------------------------------
The first text that I wrote in English. My first 4 txts in English were translations from Portuguese to Eng, but since I began the PhD I've been writing directly into Eng. I feel very happy for how I could develop it in two years, ofc thks to my friends üíü https://t.co/czZclbKsr7

@CarolynBot @kaitlynmwerner Also I found that having just finished a PhD was enough justification for a long break for anyone who asked... üòÖ I wasn't going into academia tho, so maybe the norms there are different (but also screw the norms, take time off, papers can wait!)

What drives me to get back into academia and get my PhD is the ability to have full blown discussions with people who are just as equally passionate about a subject as I am, and that make me feel like less a nerd because they‚Äôre just as talkative üòÖ
--------------------------------
@joaovc Just like any other sector of activity, academia has rules PhD students must be informed about. They must be explained transparently how it works. There are rules that apply internationally. And the  rules specific to the country you work in.

@Dr_Aust_PhD Seriously, everyone in academia needs a plan B right now, because post-covid is going to be savage. Early retirement, consultancy, shit, even working the bins if we have to.

@diana_abarca36 @Kellly_ @AcademicChatter Such good points D! I would look at job postings for the job you might want after a PhD. A lot of the jobs I would apply for in academia require clinical experience- but some don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs tough to balance, but doable.

@SusannaLHarris I've said before,  no-one suggested to me that a PhD was a route to academia: it was a chance to make an original contribution to human knowledge,  not a career move. But I wasn't from an academic background and mine was sponsored by industry so may be different.

--------------------------------
@peterrhague If true, it‚Äôs a good way to make a unique @name. It‚Äôs mostly why I started using @Dr. In academia, using Dr/PhD is indicative of a problem. Outside academia, when speaking within your domain of expertise, it can be helpful information; assuming you‚Äôre not interacting with a fool.

@AB_Harding @OpenAcademics wow - i find that genuinely shocking, thanks for telling me your experience. here in the UK new PhD students are often told "most of you wont run labs, 19/20 will leave academia eventually. start planning now" or words to the effect in career seminars
--------------------------------
I wouldn't usually weigh in on anything like this but, as I crawl towards the submission of my PhD thesis, things like this make me realise that leaving academia will be the right decision for me.
--------------------------------
@j_w_shep @OpenAcademics Not everywhere. I interviewed at one school and the department head told me that they train their PhD students for careers in academia, and there's no reason to pursue a PhD except for an academic career. It was a factor in my decision not to go there.

German academia is great because you can be proceeding in (well-cited) terms and language with a 15-30 year reception history in the rest of the world and be confidently told by a fellow PhD student not even in your field that these terms and this language are invalid.

@smsaideman @anne_vittori @Mo2Bama @RadioFreeTom Plus it assumes that it will be good (or not bad)for the careers of profs to mentor PhD students who don‚Äôt want careers in academia. I can‚Äôt speak for all business schools but for many it feels like mentoring PhD students who don‚Äôt pursue academic careers is a waste of resources.
--------------------------------
@dandrezner I think it‚Äôs worth telling graduate students that having a PhD is also very helpful outside of academia. That‚Äôs not only true of the sciences.
--------------------------------
@anne_vittori @smsaideman @RadioFreeTom I make more than my peers who graduated with me and are in academia. However, I doubled my income with my MEd but no such jump with the PhD. The ones who see an increase is academic to corporate training but its not a massive increase to justify loans to get it.
--------------------------------
@mvernal It‚Äôs a common idea in academia (at least in math &amp; physics) where ‚Äúevery decade you should switch your subfield‚Äù

My PhD advisor @preskill has done this famously well going from high energy physics -&gt; quantum aspects of black holes -&gt; quantum information -&gt; unifying all 3!
--------------------------------
@Mo2Bama @smsaideman @RadioFreeTom Same here. I think it's a cop out to discourage students pursuing the Ph.D. Departments should stop thinking so narrowly and instead aggressively market their PhD programs &amp; students to careers outside of academia.

Although I didn‚Äôt make it to a PhD, I felt the same sense of loss ‚Äúonly‚Äù leaving with my masters. However, I was tired of being used and taken for granted in academia. I had more experience in science and teaching than most of my peers, but it was never enough. https://t.co/L7HNnBIyti

@smsaideman @RadioFreeTom I got my PhD for me. Dad didn't graduate high school. I'm the first PhD on both sides. People get them for all sorts of reasons. For the bright eyed who want to pursue academia, that's going to be a struggle.

The fact that absolutely nobody is adjusting PhD funding deadlines in response to how Covid affected master's degree start dates is such a nightmare. Let me try and explain one of the many mysteries of academia ü§£
--------------------------------
@jemimatabeart @drjulie_b Because postdocs are underpaid for what we do? Which is the crux what I was saying over on the other thread. Not included, is that industry doesn't ask recent PhD graduates to do nearly as much as academia does.
--------------------------------
@tim_libert OK, but are students completely unaware of limited jobs in academia when they start? Is it all false advertising? I didn't go to school in the US, so I don't now. Oxford gave zero F. about professional training. Also, I meant once you actually commit to a PhD...

He‚Äôs also a PhD student &amp; has taught at various univs. Trust &amp; believe there are many more Benjamin Weltons hiding in plain sight. Racism &amp; white supremacy permeate academia &amp; (if we‚Äôre going to be honest) are upheld by *many* of its members.

Ok this might be a bit niche but perhaps that‚Äôs the point of this discussion about Foucault! üëáüèª

Foucault‚Äôs work on power &amp; knowledge informed my thinking for my PhD. But does Foucault‚Äôs thinking only reside in academia?

this was taught to us (PhD candidates) in our "professionalism" seminar in... 2016-ish. not in these words, but definitely with a heavy implication that we wouldn't get hired in academia if we weren't hired basically straight out of grad school or after our first temp gig. https://t.co/Bg1X4dlrpx

@BruceSiceloff @nhannahjones NOBODY gets tenure even if he/she has a PhD nowadays.

@SusannaLHarris No, I went into my PhD knowing there were lots of things you could do with a chemistry PhD outside of academia.

@smsaideman I kinda disagree with this. Even though academia is broken, the PhD path imbues people with a pretty great skill set that‚Äôs quite marketable in the private sector (especially if you get quant training).

@se_parkinson @juliaflynch Absolutely!!! To me the problem is sending the message to PhD students that life is worthless outside academia and that they‚Äôre ‚Äúlosers‚Äù if they leave.

"Things will be alright" hasn't been true since when I started and I am now a senior prof.

Maybe it will but maybe not in academia.  

and, yes, I discourage any and all students seeking Phd but they don't listen. https://t.co/dfnCw5MRQD

@SusannaLHarris @erik_cook 1/2: I hated my PhD truly, left to industry and I realized it really depends on the sector because I hated industry :P was very fancy flying business class and all but I was literally told: do not think, thinking is not your job. So now I am giving academia another go....

Sucks to say, but imo academia will continue to be a low-paying meat grinder as long as there's a surplus of available labor. Way too many people have the starry-eyed dreams when the demand for them isn't nearly as high. There need to be fewer people in PhD programs. https://t.co/urAn9BRosI

@rjzii @ryanjgallag @jw_lockhart This is what's swaying me towards industry vs academia. 
 50k for 3+ yrs to bump upto ~75k after for X yrs then slow ladder

Or walk into industry at 6 figures after PhD and be valued for my skills and expertise....
--------------------------------
@reyzz3n @ConceptualJames No doubt. It‚Äôs one reason I left academia after finishing my PhD. Science is currently being infected with wokeism &amp; social justice as opposed to hard data that exposes difficult &amp; politically inconvenient truths. Your general skepticism is justified.
--------------------------------
@neurograce I mean, I don't like it when academia is compared to a pyramid scheme (as I think PhD has an intrinsic value that separate from career success), but there's a bit of this dynamics in academia that you don't now what you are subscribing for until you get there.
--------------------------------
@SusannaLHarris I believe we all look at this issue upside down. Only a small percentage of people that finish a PhD end up in what we call the academic track, so that should be the alternative path. We tend to see people that are not in academia as having somehow left. That is the wrong message
--------------------------------
Dr. @JenGommerman received her PhD at @UofT in Immunology before completing her post-doctoral fellowship at @Harvard. She then worked as a staff scientist at @biogen for 3 years before returning to Academia at @UofT! She is currently studying the antibody response to #COVID19!ü¶†

I'm also partial to her mentor, Daniel Block. I've always loved the OT &amp; his classes helped me understand why.
--------------------------------
@MixedClassicist This is pretty much what I tell people. If tgey are dreaming of academia, still have a plan B, C, D. And don't do it unless the three-four years are worth it in themselves (accounting for times thag will be difficult). Doing a PhD can and should be a joy in itself. /
--------------------------------
@MattNiessner Do you think deep understanding has become a pre-req of sorts in academia even? The aim for PhD/MS is usually to attain a deeper understanding or do you feel we have enough resources to achieve that outside academia?
--------------------------------
Congratulations to Camilla Rossini (https://t.co/e2Rdxla9u7) on successfully representing (there was no need to defend) her pathbreaking PhD diss -- her work makes possible a new generation of truly digital editions.
--------------------------------
@MixedClassicist The advice I give is that wanting an academic job isn't *enough* of a reason to do a PhD. If you have the niggle - absolutely. But don't have academia as your own plan or the Reason For Doing It. I did mine because I wasn't finished with the subject, not because I wanted a job.
--------------------------------
Good advice. Remember too: only 50% of PhD students in #humanities finish their doctorate &amp; very, very few of those folks will get TT jobs in academia (ever).

There's a lot of luck involved. Don't be too hard on yourself/others if you're not one of the chosen.
#AcademicChatter https://t.co/g2ywnAGtQU
--------------------------------
PhD folks considering a move beyond academia often deal with grief -- loss of a sense of self, loss of a "dream job" vision of their career &amp; life. Focus on what elements of yourself &amp; that vision are truly fundamental to who you are &amp; what you want, then seek them out elsewhere.
--------------------------------
@zachanglin @shawnwillden @hypatiadotca Yeah similar in cryptography, where I'd say it's around 20-50%. But I think that's just reinforcing the company being trash: you don't advertise with the number of PhDs you have. Either those PhD are useful, because it's an engineering subdiscipline that is close to academia

Final plenary going on at the @ifip_94 PhD day! How can we work together to build a supportive environment in #academia? #IFIP942021
--------------------------------
Thanks to those who joined us on Sunday! We asked ourselves why we're all persuing a PhD or career in academia, the best answer: "We love science!".
--------------------------------
We know how frightening it can be to leave academia and move into non-ac fields. But trust us when we say, you ARE employable. Your PhD is an exemplar of all the skills you've used to get that PhD, and it's these same skills that matter most to non ac employers.
--------------------------------
Great session on 'Handling rejection in academia' earlier by @LindaKKaye. 
Really positive aspects such as 'celebrating rejection', and loved psychological insights like 'demonstrating mastery' (e.g. through PhD work or publishing a blog post). 
Strong recommend!

--------------------------------
@Caroline_Clason It really is kind of stupid anyways, because not everyone's goal in a PHD is to continue in academia. As long as the thesis is online, it is for all intents and purposes "published". I only had one paper done when I finished and I am still around.
--------------------------------
@francesbiggin @AcademicChatter By the end of my PhD, I was certain I wanted to leave academia and science. I hadn't secured a job. One of my mentors suggested I apply for a 1 yr postdoc as a stopgap. Turns out I love academia and science and bioinformatics. It's OK to be unsure.
--------------------------------
@francesbiggin @AcademicChatter I don‚Äôt have a PhD but am searching. From what I‚Äôve gathered it is *okay* to treat academia as just a job‚Ä¶there just does not seem to be anyone who can actually do it. The unpaid extra work is a defining feature of the industry. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone fully rising above it
--------------------------------
@ProfRachelGaN @Ky_Summers86 @ZJAyres I am one of those who was an industry funded PhD, as you mentioned I am an inventor on patents not an author on papers from my main project. Currently a research fellow having stayed in academia

‚ÄúAcademic careers with a human face‚Äù is our second panel at @ifip_94 PhD day! @Andrejcisneros, @CarolineKhene, @philochal &amp; Luiz Joia discuss human aspects of academia, and how to preserve #health and #happiness through the PhD journey. A very important discussion at #IFIP942021
--------------------------------
I always feel panic when I read such tweets: how can academia be so unfair? Yes, PhD students should experiment! Yet: I published 3 papers as a 2nd year phd student &amp; more later.

@francesbiggin @AcademicChatter No. I don‚Äôt intend to stay in academia after my PhD. Perhaps I can try part time but still Ill go in the industry
--------------------------------
Question for @AcademicChatter peeps: is it okay to stay in academia after a phd if you‚Äôre not 100% committed to it? I mean, I think research is a fine job, but it‚Äôs not the be-all and end-all of my life. Is it possible to treat academia as ‚Äòjust a job‚Äô?
#phdchat #AcademicTwitter

I felt ashamed for asking for any kind of help. 
But I realized that in academia, no one stops learning. It‚Äôs important to recognize that mentors training PhD students is not only to teach the student, but also the other way around.

If we want to work together across industry &amp; academia, we have to start forming connections earlier.

@Chrizzy80 @ZJAyres Very True.....The only reason if I ever choose to leave academia would be its pay value.

@lifesafeast I need to elaborate. I was initially a PhD student, and I would have been teaching anatomy to grads and undergrads. When I decided I didn't want to be in academia, I got out with a Master's. THere are no jobs for that degree. If you can think of one, you will be the first ever.

@lpachter I started a PhD back in 2009 &amp; was in a toxic lab. I was told that if I left my career in academia was over, and I almost believed it. I left &amp; retrained in a different field. Took years to find my way back. So yeah, I agree, leaving a bad lab is very hard
--------------------------------
@adamscrabble Yeah, the smartest friend I have was on his way to a PhD in the history of science before he realized there was zero future in it. He has five kids. Now he‚Äôs a Silicon Valley millionaire as a data scientist. Academia is largely rotten. Harvard is a hedge fund with a school.

Pro-tip: Most PhD programs in the US are funded, you get a stipend, health insurance and pay no tuition. You‚Äôll probably have to teach one or two classes as a TA, but it‚Äôs a great thing to pursue if you‚Äôre indecisive about what you want to do and don‚Äôt mind academia.
--------------------------------
@lidlbich Academia rewards people who get scholarships like these - you're more likely to get into a PhD program and get funding if you've been awarded a scholarship in the past. These scholarships are merit-based not really need-based so it isn't just about the money.

@mathyenginerd If you wish to stay in academia, a good advisor will help you develop a research plan towards the end of your PhD. This, in addition to the skills and insight you gained in grad school, will help you to formulate your own problems. You‚Äôre in no rush!

@ZJAyres I completely agree, after this year academia might start to see a significant number of graduating PhDs leaving to work industry better paying jobs becs they can work from home thankfully (obviously this can't work for all PhD areas unless you have a lab in your house üòÇ)
--------------------------------
@pauvenachem @ZJAyres It is not enough Paula. After finishing your Phd, if you want to stay in academia, you should go to US first and stay 2 years as a PD, then to Australia and spend another 2 years. Thereafter, maaaybe just maybe you might have a slight chance of finding a permanent position.

@so_radhikal The structure of Academia and PhD is such like the world over that it have taken a completely newer worst (corrupt) form in India.
--------------------------------
@DrSpratticus This was also coupled with the notion (in the not too distant past) that a PhD was required to match into RadOnc and/or to be retained/recruited as faculty in academia.
--------------------------------
@so_radhikal Nepotism in academia is probably the most dangerous of all. Just look at the appointments of assistant professors in IITs or IISc. Unless you have done your phD under some "powerful" indian senior prof who knows the recruiting committee members, you stand no chance.

A minor but odd thing - since starting my PhD, men (who are not in academia) send me any story on Mass Effect. News I already know. There is never a comment. It's not the start of a chat about ME. The impression is "you'll need this for your work and I am giving it to you"

@scarlett_jazmin My impressions from just over 10 years from getting the PhD and staying in academia: the happily-ever-after doesn‚Äôt seem to ever come, even whilst holding a faculty post. Job alerts have never been turned off. But with grants/fellowships, you kick the can down the road a little.
--------------------------------
@ElasmoFan5 That's okay. It seems to be easier to have a career after the PhD if you've done things outside of academia too. There are useful skills to be learned in the real world. Like being fully functional without a supervisor. (This is anecdotal, though; I don't have data for that.)

--------------------------------
@stuartsmyth66 I always keep in mind that most of my PhD students won‚Äôt work  in academia - even though the system would benefit from them. They still get a great skill set.
--------------------------------
@ThatJohnChaffee The entire system is broken. Academia is in a death spiral: its neoliberal privatization depends on exploiting faculty labor, which it overproduces through underfunded PhD programs that leave students in debt and w/o job prospects. It's a deeply toxic environment.
--------------------------------
An observation from being a year into a PhD program: either KSU's PFP PhD program is incredible or the culture of #academia at large is fundamentally toxic. Maybe both?

@EpistemicHope Seems possible. I think I‚Äôve grown steadily more dismayed with academia as I‚Äôve progressed through it (3rd year PhD), plausibly bc im unable to hack it but it really seems like it‚Äôs bc academia sucks :p on net I‚Äôm def glad it exists, though
--------------------------------
The advice I always give to prospective  PhD students:

1) Do it only if you have full funding
2) Approach it mainly as an opportunity for deep and rigorous personal exploration, not professionalization
3) Do not expect to find a secure job in academia on the other side of it https://t.co/JSakZXcPeA

@pol_antras @YaleCowles Fair.

@SJ_8040 I am far from anti academia - I have a degree, I would like to do a PhD at some point - but it should not come at the expense of the basics of training. Training should be being extended, not reduced, in order to accommodate the additional content.

Inspirational. However, age discrimination in academia is a fact. Struggled to start a PhD. Got a scholarship at 32 and first thing I heard that they were too skeptical about my age. Already thinking that PostDoc at 36 may raise some eyebrows but who cares. #phdlife https://t.co/dZIbMuRolb

Writing my book has been self-directed study. But, after a PhD, I know what I DON‚ÄôT know. I believe in the education system and appreciate what it offers, despite the many challenges academia is facing. Education is a process, not a product. And I‚Äôll never be too proud to learn.

@pol_antras Maybe I‚Äôm opening Pandora‚Äôs box, but that statement is quite tricky... Would someone saying they want to end up in the IMF/WB/Tech in their application be accepted into a (top) Econ PhD? Ex post most academics are understanding. But ex ante, the goal needs to be academia, IMHO
--------------------------------
Doing a PhD is hard. 

There are obvious intellectual demands. But beyond these, many outside academia don't realise how much it requires in terms of self-discipline, hard-work, and mental strength, for a prolonged period of time.

It is truly a labour of love and commitment.
--------------------------------
@jliedl There was a time in college that I really, really wanted to go all the way up and get a PhD and then...money ran out, burnout happened and I had a very different life, and now I'm kind of okay with that, looking at academia today. Which is sad!
--------------------------------
@vaishnavigator Well that's a very good question. Post PhD one should look after non academic avenues as it could provides significant amount of industry exposure and in particular increases the chance of academia-industry collaboration., in case one wants to switch to academics later on.

@noraannedevlin Toxic system or environment (i.e. #academia) (re)produces toxic emotional consequences (e.g. guilt)‚Ä¶

#JustSaying #AcademicTwitter #AcademicChatter
--------------------------------
@jeanpaul_phd Thanks. That's good advice. I think my feeling a sense of responsibility to share an informed opinion is not quite the same as feeling guilty, but I think you're right and that it's a slippery slope down to guilt. Why must so much in academia lead back to guilt?

I wonder what impact the pandemic will have on this cohort of incoming PhD students. How many will drop out (if they didn‚Äôt already)? What is the impact of lack of in-person socialization? More or less likely to leave academia upon completion?

Whoa! Biting my tongue on the bigger issue, in no small part coz I don't understand all the intricacies of cryptocurency. But if anyone is listening, the goal of Econ PhD programs is to train PhD economists, NOT necessarily academic economists. Academia is just one of many paths! https://t.co/DkbGS2ISQI

@RafiknWahbi Bro you are a Fucking rock star. Knowing you and your work from BUSPH, don‚Äôt get caught up in the noise of WSC in academia that pits us against ourselves. You got into UCLA for a PhD, that‚Äôs huge homie. You know yourself and your work keep stepping and you will find some clarity.
--------------------------------
The last few months in my PhD have confirmed that I‚Äôm absolutely an autoethnographer, and also that I want to teach for my career (not necessarily wedded to being in academia forever though). Nice to be reaching a point of certainty and forward momentum.
--------------------------------
@IjeomaOo there‚Äôs a lot of privelege in academia. I am a PhD student and sole income earner. I often get asked why I don‚Äôt stop working (one day per week) and focus on my PhD studies. My standard response is to ask if they‚Äôre offering to pay my mortgage.
--------------------------------
I‚Äôm revising an essay about my academia zine and reflecting about how in PhD inductions consortiums and universities enforce the idea that PhD students should be grateful for funding, and this automatically enforces a sense of subjugation?
--------------------------------
@Charlie_the_II I'm not. It's just where I did my PhD. That's why my https://t.co/uv5rohYHEs page is linked there. 

Which may explain my forthright opinions :)
--------------------------------
@daliagebrial Its notable that when you say you've done/are doing a PhD outside of academia its recognised as a tough/impressive thing in itself, but people in the academy refer to it as an 'apprenticeship' &amp; 'training', which you should basically grateful for being allowed to.

@CARTAUCSD 20 yrs on, how many students of palaeoanth have been encouraged to look at wading as a model of the evolution of human bipedalism?

I suspect the answer is ZERO. 

I went back to academia to do so and the evidence is strong. MSc and PhD here... https://t.co/FyS7awsSN8 https://t.co/HJZzAqCEh0

UK-, white- and academia-centricism are some potent drugs. These folks can‚Äôt fathom why any migrant, BAME or Global South scholar would have complicated feelings on the matter.

@James_West_PhD @ijbailey @rasmansa @nhannahjones A Ph.D is a terminal degree in computer science.

Few people work in computer science outside of academia. Software development is an entirely different subject, and a career in that would not generally qualify one to work as a professor, certainly not at a research university.
--------------------------------
the first rotation student I  mentored is defending her PhD next month, and one of my best friends just had her paper accepted that I was lucky enough to collaborate on. 

academia can really suck ass, but I LOVE getting to train, work with, and learn from amazing scientists!!
--------------------------------
@James_West_PhD @rasmansa @nhannahjones What you should be learning is that the qualifications for Journalism Schools are different than for the parts of academia where a Ph. D is a terminal degree. This is a feature it shares with other professional schools like arts and business.

@365chimera @wildfl0wer_X @kikimancy Very plausible hypothesis. I returned to academia to try to find out why the field of palaeoanthropology ignored it or sneered at it. 22 years, a PhD, 12 articles and a book later, I have come to the conclusion that there is no good reason. Just tribalism.
https://t.co/km33q3exSc
--------------------------------
@Oli_Misquitta For sure! I moved to the UK to study an MSc and later a PhD, then when I finished I went through the process of getting my GMC registration, so not the usual path of most IMGS. I love academia but was missing clinical work. If you can do both is very rewarding.
--------------------------------
@CaraAnselmo @ShipLives Hard same. Given how often the systems of my workplace remind me my terminal degree isn't a PhD (and thus, largely doesn't count), it's amusing. I *do* appreciate that they default to Dr., considering the on-going discussions re respect for women in academia. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
